## Data avaibility

Graph-based signatures for case studies 1 and 2. They were obtained running aCSM-ALL algorithm (cutoff step of 0.2 A and cutoff max of 20A). These files contain the data used as input for the case studies carried out in the work by Martins et al. (2023):
- data_experiment_1_cutoff_0_2_max_20.csv.zip
- data_experiment_2_cutoff_0_2_max_20.csv.zip
